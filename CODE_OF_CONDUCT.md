# Code of Conduct

In this open-source project, our aim is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment. We expect all contributors
and participants interact with each other with courtesy, respect and kindness.

We will not tolerate abuse or harassment of any kind.

In the event of a concern about behaviour, please contact the maintainers of the project:

* Dennis Schwertel <dennis.swchwertel@divio.com>
* Daniele Procida <daniele.procida@divio.com>

Reports will be taken seriously and treated in confidence. If necessary, the maintainers will act to exclude
individuals from participating in this and other projects.


## Code review

Code review can be a frustrating process for both contributors and reviewers, with many opportunities for mutual
misunderstanding.

We expect participants who submit contributions for review to understand and accept that all contributions to the
project, including code and the ideas behind it, will be reviewed carefully. Often review will include critique and
criticism, and will almost always require improvements or other changes before contributions can be accepted.

We also expect reviewers to communicate sensitively and respectfully.

This is in line with a shared aim for the success of the project.
